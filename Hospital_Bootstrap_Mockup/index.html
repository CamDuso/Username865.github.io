            Butterflies for Bereaved Parents Month
        </button>

        <div class="accordion-body">
          <strong>Those words, written by author Jan Richardson, will appear in the mailboxes of parents who have lost a child cared for at Mass General for Children (MGfC) during July’s Bereaved Parents Month. The poem, tucked in a small white package with wildflower seed paper butterflies, is a touchpoint from the new Pediatric Bereavement Program.

            In January, MGfC launched the two-year pilot program to provide ongoing support to families for two years as they navigate their grief and mourn the life-altering loss of their child. This includes immediate needs, such as coordinating memorial services or explaining loss to a child, to long-term challenges of marking milestone birthdays and holidays.
            
            “As a program, this is our first opportunity to honor the parents of children who have died during the internationally recognized Bereaved Parents Month,” says Mary Barber Bussiere, LICSW, a social worker and Pediatric Bereavement Program coordinator. “Butterflies are often viewed as a symbol that a loved one is communicating with them and is ok. The seeds are perennials, which come back each year, representing the everlasting love a parent has for a child.”
            
            According to a study published in the American Psychological Association, the death of a child puts bereaved parents at risk for mental and physical health complications, including depression, premature death and suicide.
            
            “A child’s passing is one of the most stressful and distressing life events a person can experience,” says Patricia O’Malley, MD, medical advisor for the Pediatric Bereavement Program at MGfC. “It is our job as caregivers to keep bereaved families company in their grief and provide support and guidance for them even after they have left the encompassing care of the hospital team. Their grief doesn’t end here, our program accompanies them as they learn to integrate their grief into their new lives. The bereavement program hopes to do this by providing necessary therapeutic support and connection to community resources.”
            
            Bereaved Parents Month aims to raise awareness of the support necessary when someone loses a child. “To honor bereaved parents, we encourage individuals to reach out to loved ones or members of their communities who have experienced the death of a life,” says Barber Bussiere. “Ask about their favorite memories with their child, share your favorite memories, and most importantly, say their name.”
            
            Barber Bussiere and O’Malley hope this small token will not only comfort parents, but act as reminder that the Pediatric Bereavement Program is available and empower them to seek out help.

            Discrimination Took A Toll on the Mental Health of Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups During the COVID-19 Pandemic
        </button>
      </h2>
      <div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingTwo">
        <div class="accordion-body">
          <strong>BOSTON – Everyday discrimination experienced by people of racial and ethnic minority groups during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with significantly increased odds of moderate to severe depression and thoughts of suicide, researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and their colleagues have found.

            In a study in JAMA Psychiatry, the team reported that the greater the discrimination, the more pronounced the depressive symptoms.
            
            The associations with depression during the pandemic were highest among Hispanic/Latino and Asian/Pacific Islander participants when the main reason for discrimination was based on race, ancestry, or national origin.
            
            “Previous studies have documented the adverse health effects of discrimination, but we were surprised at the magnitude of the effect on the mental health and quality of life of people who have often had to deal with intolerance in their everyday lives,” says Jordan Smoller, MD, ScD, associate chief for research in the MGH Department of Psychiatry.
            
            “In fact, at high levels of everyday discrimination, the association with moderate to severe depressive symptoms was similar to the effect of having a pre-pandemic mood disorder diagnosis, which is pretty dramatic.”
            
            For communities that routinely face structural racism – including Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian/Pacific Islander – the pandemic has been a particularly stressful period, given higher rates of unemployment, food and housing insecurity, limited access to healthcare, and even racially motivated violence.
            
            Drawing on the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, a highly diverse database that is fueling research across a host of health fields (including mental health), the MGH team probed the consequences of discrimination during the early pandemic period within a cohort of nearly 63,000 individuals in the largest and most diverse analysis of its type.
            
            Investigators learned that among participants who reported discrimination due to race or ancestry more than once a week, there were seventeen-fold increased odds of moderate to severe depressive symptoms, and a ten-fold increased risk of suicidal ideation.
            
            The COVID-19 Participant Experience (COPE) survey of the All of Us Research Program defined discrimination as being treated with less courtesy or respect than other people, for example, receiving poorer service at restaurants and other facilities, or being called names, threatened, or harassed.
            
            “The pandemic precipitated a dramatic increase in racially motivated attacks on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders,” notes lead author Younga “Heather” Lee, PhD, an MGH investigator who emigrated from South Korea to the U.S. 11 years ago to continue her education.
            
            “Our study and others suggest that the consequences of anti-Asian racism include stress, depression, anxiety, and even thoughts of suicide.”
            
            Smoller emphasized the need for clinicians and society-at-large to more fully recognize the “toxic effect” that discrimination and racism can have on the mental health of individuals.
            
            “Inequities are not inevitable,” he says, “but for changes to occur, we must work harder to understand and address the kinds of discrimination that some communities experience and the toll it can take on their health and everyday lives.”
            
            Smoller is a professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School (HMS). Lee is a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Psychiatry, HMS, and in the Psychiatric & Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine at MGH. Co-author Cheryl Clark, MD, is an assistant professor of Medicine, HMS, and associate chief, Division of General Internal Medicine and Primary Care, Brigham and Women's Hospital.
            
            The study was supported by the International HundredK+ Cohorts Consortium (IHCC), which has been created in collaboration with the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and the Global Genomics Medicine Collaborative (G2MC) with support from the National Institute of Health and the Wellcome Trust.

          <strong>PURPOSE: To ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in the evaluation of candidates with Substance Use Disorders.

            POLICY:  Massachusetts General Hospital has ongoing initiatives to treat Substance Use Disorders as chronic illnesses with improved access to effective treatment opportunities available across all care settings. Mass General will not impose eligibility criteria that unnecessarily deny or limit treatment for individuals on the basis of disability, including Substance Use Disorders, and those who are receiving treatment for Substance Use Disorders. Candidacy for organ transplantation is not, therefore, excluded for Mass General patients with Substance Use Disorders under appropriate treatment programs, including opioid agonist therapy. Mass General will also not otherwise discriminate on the basis of disability. Organ-specific transplant programs will continue to assess each potential recipient on a case-by-case basis including psychosocial screening by Selection Committees.
