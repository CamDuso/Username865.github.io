  <p id="para1">I suppose we could talk about who I am considering how that's the entire point of this webpage existing. I'm (clearly) just learning how to code using html after a breezy 13 year long career in hospitality, most of what i've gained from all this time spent serving people are a lot of stories about restaurant life in Boston; regardless, I'm quite excited to make my debut in the tech world. If I had anything else interesting to say I would put it here but whenever I try to recall any of my hobbies or what I'm like in any capacity I completely forget.

  <p id="para1">However this is a picture of my cat, his name is Eddie and he is a very good boy.
